Amongst our many activities, we will mentor students through the college application process, host networking events and soft skill-building workshops, and serve as an easy-access resource for finding scholarship and internship opportunities.</p>

        <p>In the case that you do not comply with the terms and conditions listed, EAF reserves the right to withhold your access to our services. </p>
        <p>Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns regarding the Terms and Conditions at <a href="mailto:educationatlasf@gmail.com">educationatlasf@gmail.com</a></p>

        <br /><h3><b>Accurate Information.</b></h3><br />
        <p>All students utilizing EAF's services should do their best to report the most accurate information to the best of their abilities, such as current grades, test scores, resumes, cover letters, and profiles. It is imperative that students provide complete and correct factual information in order to acquire the most detailed advice and service that EAF's mentors can offer. It is the student's responsibility to provide all correct, complete, and current information essential to the college application process to acquire the most of EAF's mentoring services.</p>
        <p>If students fail to report complete and honest records of any solicited information, it can hinder the mentors from offering the most specific and honest feedback. Additionally, the failure to report essential, complete, and accurate information may result in the possible consequence of being denied EAF's services. </p>

        <br /><h3><b>Privacy Policy.</b></h3><br />
        <p>In accordance with <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB568">Chapter 22.1 Privacy Rights for Minors in the Digital World</a>, any and all personal data that EAF may require will not be disclosed, shared, or authorized to any third parties outside of the organization's members, to the general public, or to other students. Personal data that may be collected will consist of first and last names, email address, and the name of the high school in which the student is attending. Students' personal information will be stored in secure databases only accessible to EAF's founding members. All and any information gathered from students will be kept under strict confidentiality. Students will not have access to any information regarding their peers within the organization.</p>
        <p>During mentoring sessions, students reserve the right to retain any information they discern is not applicable to their mentoring process. All EAF mentors will respect students' rights to withhold any personal information they deem to not be necessary during the mentoring process. </p>
        <p>Information that will be collected by mentors during mentoring sessions will range from students' GPAs, essays, standardized test scores, supplemental writing, and resumes. The sole purpose of acquiring such information is to provide students with the best possible advice. EAF mentors will not publicize, share, or use any of the students' information for personal use or third parties. The information EAF may request will serve the sole purpose of facilitating the mentoring services that EAF strives to provide to students. The Education Atlas Foundation will not gather personal data in relation to the above mentioned materials such as home address, telephone number, or Social Security number. All forms of contact will be conducted via email, therefore any other contact information will not be collected.</p>
        <p>Meetings, workshops, and foundation events will all be recorded in the form of audio or video for legal purposes. Virtual meetings, workshops, mentoring sessions, and events will be recorded as well. In the event students or legal guardians have an issue with being recorded, contact the Education Atlas Foundation via email. </p>

        <br /><h3><b>Parental Permission.</b></h3><br />
        <p>In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act enacted under by Congress in 1998, EAF will require legal consent before requesting any information regarding minors under the age of 18 years. </p>

        <br /><h3><b>Technology.</b></h3><br />
        <p>In conducting online meetings and mentoring sessions, mentors are expected to keep their microphones and cameras on at all times. </p>
        <p>Students are highly urged to keep their cameras and microphones on during meetings. However, if students experience any difficulty in maintaining their cameras during meetings, then students should notify their mentors of this. In the case that students are unable to use their cameras for meetings, then the waived use of camera is permissible, but the use of a microphone is essential in maintaining a line of communication with their mentors.</p>
